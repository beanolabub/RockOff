<h2>What's it about?</h2>

A game that lets you choose a weapon and automatically generates a weapon to vs against you, it then works out whether you won or lost.
I've added extra bits like messages enticing you to try again depending on whether you won the round or not.  It keeps track of the scores and rounds usin localStorage.  All images are SVG  /CSS which makes the filesize of app very small (~80 Kb).
It probably wasn't entirely necessary but I used scss instead of CSS just get my eye in.

<h2>Why make it?</h2>

I'm learning more advanced JavaScript at the moment and was looking for a game to build to test my skills and I remembered that I used to teach how to make this game in Scratch with my my key stage 3 students back in the old days so it's a game I understand very well!

<h2>Result? To consolidate or not to consolidae?</h2>

I don't think I learnt anything new when building this project but it consolidated my learning nicely, as it's a traditional game there is nothing special about this project!

<h2>Credits</h2>

I managed to do this one completely by myself apart from a couple of lookups on stackoverflow
